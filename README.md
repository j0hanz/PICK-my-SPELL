# Design

## Colour Scheme

![Colour_Scheme](https://github.com/j0hanz/PICK-my-SPELL/assets/159924955/cbc1da44-2d50-4903-97a1-085897ab36d0)

Took inspiration from [coolors.com](https://coolors.co/1e1e1d-252422-ff0000-37ff00-ababab-ffffff)

## Typography

Font family used on this website is imported from Google fonts: [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) 

Icons shown during game Is taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Wireframes

When I started this project, I used Balsamiq to draw how I wanted the website to look like. I made some changes during the development.
